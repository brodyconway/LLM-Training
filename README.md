The code in this repository is meant for studying LLM performance purposes. I've trained and tested multiple LLMs with this code, which was saved as model/checkpoint-x (x being the number of sample data the LLM was trained with). The LLMs were pretrained from scratch with the dataset https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/OpenOrca/tree/main. The code in this repository is a complete way to train and run your LLM.  To train an LLM using this code, simply upload a dataset in .parquet form that has "question" and "response" columns (or change the load_and_format_data function to use the columns your dataset has). Then change the "parquet_path" (to your data's path) in train.py. To run the LLM in run_LLM.py, change the number represented for the "model_path" variable to whichever checkpoint you want to test.
